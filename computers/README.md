# Computers in Te Papanui Enderley Community Trust.

Version: 2021-02-09

## Introduction

The Community Trust provides desktop computers at the Centre that they manage in Tennyson St. 
The computers are installed with applications so that word-processing, spreadsheet calculations 
or programming, etc., may be performed. They also are connected to the internet so that web-based 
activities may be performed. For examples, e-mailing, reading news articles, watching video clips, etc.

The computers have been donated. They are second-hand and have been fully depreciated. They are 
received with all software having been scrubbed from the disk drives. On some occasions additional 
components need to be purchased to add to the computer to enhance its performance and make it 
suitable for use in the Centre.

Upon receiving these computers they are installed with [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (OSS). 
This includes the operating system, utilities and applications.

The software incurs no licensing costs to download, copy and use. The software is installed by 
volunteers and a complete software installation takes about 30 minutes per computer.

[Canonical Ltd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company)). and a community of developers 
produce and maintain [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu), which is the software distribution 
that is downloaded and installed. Ubuntu collect a selection of open source software applications 
which they compile to become executable code and then they test these executable images. As all the 
computers at the centre use AMD64 architecture CPUs, it is the code compiled for this architecture 
that is downloaded and installed. 

Ubuntu distributions are provided in at least six different desktop flavours. The centre has currently 
chosen to use the *Mate* flavour. The *Ubuntu Mate desktop* has a simple layout and should be intuitive 
for children to learn how to use it. 

The centre computers are maintained by applying Ubuntu's [Long Term Support](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) (LTS) 
release strategy. While updates may be regularly applied, a long term support release occurs every two years. 
This is normally in June on the even numbered years. All computers at the centre may then be upgraded to the 
latest release by the performing of an on-line upgrade.

The installation and maintenance of this software is performed by volunteers. By utilizing the distributions 
from Ubuntu minimal volunteer labour is required to install and maintain the software compared with the 
labour requirements of equivalent software from proprietary software vendors. This is one of the main 
reasons why proprietary software is not used on these computers.

## Software Suppliers

Many of the suppliers of Open Source Software are not-for-profit foundations. For examples: 

* The operating system kernel is maintained by the [Linux Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation).

* [Libreoffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice), the office productivity suite, is a project 
of [The Document Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Document_Foundation) (TDF).

* The [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) web browser is provided by the 
[Mozilla Firefox Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation).

* [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)) is a free and open-source 3D computer 
graphics software toolset. It is developed by the [Blender Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_Foundation)

* The [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) programming language is 
developed by the [Python Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation) (PSF).

Open Source Software applications on a smaller scale may not warrant being supported by a foundation. 
Often they simply use github to host their source code, and invite programmers to develop it further. For examples:

* [mpv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpv_%28media_player%29) A media player that has its source code 
hosted on github at [mpv-player](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)

* [pluma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluma_(text_editor)) is the default text editor of the MATE 
desktop environment. It's source code is on github at [pluma](https://github.com/mate-desktop/pluma).


## Document Storage Format

The supplied LibreOffice suite of applications defaults to storing documents in the compliance with the 
[Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_(organization)) (OASIS) [OpenDocument Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) ISO/IEC [26300:2006](https://www.iso.org/standard/43485.html). This ISO/IEC 26300 standard was initial released on 1 May 2005. The latest release, on 21 January 2020, is 1.3.

The *OASIS OpenDocument Format* should not be confused with the [Office Open XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) (OOXML) 
ISO/IEC [29500:2008](https://www.iso.org/standard/51463.html) standard that was initially released a few years later in November 2008.

LibreOffice supports reading and writing Office Open XML files.


## Computer Hardware Configuration

The donated hardware is fully depreciated. Thus, with no value, no insurance is required.

The hardware should meet a minimum specification which ensures an adequate level of performance. In some 
cases a small investment is required to buy components to upgrade the computers to meet the specification.

Additional costs per computer should not exceed $50 in petty cash. These costs may include, SSD, power cords, 
wifi card, etc., purchased, where possible, from a second hand dealer / re-cycler.

Residents of this community should be encouraged to have similar computer systems and know how to configure 
the hardware to build them and install the free open-source software.
Each computer should meet these minimum specification:

* Quad core 3GHz CPU.
* 4GB DDR3 Memory.
* 100GB Solid State Disk drive.
* Ethernet port at 1Gb/s
* 1600 x 900 (16:9) or 1280 x 1024 (5:4) pixel Monitor.
* Keyboard.
* Mouse.
* Power cords and SVGA cable.

It is preferred if the computer has a wifi adapter as this allows more flexibility in where it is positioned. 
The wifi should at least be in the 2.4GHz band with dual antennas for the feature of diversity receiving.

An on-board speaker may provide sound, but its use is not encouraged as the working environment should be 
treated much the same as when in a library and kept quiet so people can concentrate. If a user wishes to 
listen to audio then they should bring their own earphones to plug into the computer.

There may or may not be a microphone. It is not intended that these computers are provided for audio 
communications, such as when using applications like, Skype or Zoom. 

The computer hardware should be of a high quality design with a high mean time to failure (MTTF). This is to 
ensure the on-going maintenance involves a minimal amount of man-hours.

In most cases the Centre will only carry a small amount of spare parts that can be used to repair computers 
that have hardware problems. The general repair strategy will be to scrap a computer to a re-cycler and replace 
it with another donated second-hand computer. Prior to scrapping a computer its RAM and SSD will be removed 
and kept as spares by the Centre.

Three catagories of computers are available for use at the Centre:

* HP 8x00 series Small Form Factor Desktop.
* Dell OptiPlex 9010 Small Form Factor Desktop.
* Lenovo ThinkCentre Edge 72z All-in-1.

Additionally there are two older computers. They are primarily used to play music from spotify or youtube clips.  

## Ergonomics

The following is a list of guidelines for consideration of the ergonomics of each desktop computer.

* Desk area minimum width of 80cm should be allocated for each computer.
* Desk depth should provide room for A4 sized paper between the top of the keyboard and the monitor.
* Chairs should be adjustable in height.
* Curtains that can be drawn to stop bright sunlight shining into the room and onto computer screens.
* The desk surface should be suitable for operating a mouse. If not provide a mouse pad.

## Operating System and Applications

The operating system will be free open-source software distribution from a renowned distro provider. For 
example Ubuntu with their Mate flavour distro.

The methods used to download, install and tailor the Operating System and Applications is documented as a 
check-list to be followed by a person experienced with OSS.

This check-list document is available here.

## Network

All computers are connected to internet services that are paid for by the Centre. It is up to the individual 
users not to abuse this network service.

[Link](/network/README.md) to network information.

## Printer

The Centre has a network printer. Users logged into the *Career* account may perform printing. The *Enderley* 
account does not provide printing capability.

[Link](/printer/README.md) to printer information.

## Storage of Documents

The Centre is not responsible for maintaining the storage of documents that have been created or downloaded. 
Individuals need to bring their own USB stick and copy their files to this device, or email their files as 
attachments to their e-mail accounts, etc. 

Files stored in the *Enderley* account are deleted upon logging out of the account and then logging back in. 


## Ongoing Maintenance

It is envisaged that there will be residents in the community that have an interest in volunteering their 
time and knowledge to maintain the computer equipment. Their main duty will be to regularly apply the 
latest set of updates to all computers.

If suitable training is provided to these volunteers, then it is expected they would be able to install 
software distributions and repair faulty hardware.


## Purchasing Guideline.

* Avoid buying major IT products brand new.
* Only ever buy the cheap IT accessories brand new.
* Use second hand or donated IT hardware products.
* Use only free open source software products.
